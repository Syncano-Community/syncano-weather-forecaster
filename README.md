# Syncano Weather Forecaster Mini Hack

This mini hack is designed to introduce you to Syncano Solutions, which can be installed into your Syncano Instance to give it additional functionality. In this example, we'll install a Solution to bring in current weather data for any city and state combination. Then, we will output the current weather information onto the page.

To get started, clone this repo:

`git clone http://github.com/Syncano-Community/syncano-weather-forecaster`

Open the `index.html` file in the browser of your choice. This page has already been set up with a field for `city` and `state`. JQuery and Syncano are already included on the page, and the necessary jQuery has already been written for you. It's up to you to set up what's needed in your Syncano Dashboard and write the correct code to get the weather data. There are a few things you will have to do:

* Find the appropriate Syncano Solution for Weather Data
* Set up a Webhook to access the Solution
* Write the proper code to use your Webhook

If you run into any issues, take a look at our [docs](http://docs.syncano.io/). Remember, completing 1 mini hack gets you a free Syncano t-shirt, completing 3 gets your name into our drawing for a large prize, and being one of the first 5 people to complete all 5 mini hacks gets you a special prize. Once you've completed this mini hack, bring your solution by the Syncano booth for verification. Good luck!
